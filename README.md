# BharatYatra â€“ Airline Reservation System

**BharatYatra** is a comprehensive Airline Reservation System developed as an academic project to simulate a real-world flight booking platform. Initially built using **Core Java**, it was later upgraded using **Advanced Java (Servlets & JDBC)** for enhanced web functionality and seamless database integration.

This system allows both customers and administrators to interact with an intuitive user interface to manage bookings, check flight statuses, and oversee flight schedules.
# Features
- **User Registration & Login:** Secure signup and login with validations.
- **Flight Booking:** Book flights by selecting available routes, dates, and class.
- **View Bookings:** See all current bookings tied to the user session.
- **Check Flight Status:** Browse available flights and view route & availability.

# Admin Module
- **Add Flight:** Admin can add new flight schedules with route, date, and class.
- **Flight Management (Planned):** Edit and remove flights, view all bookings.
